# Project Overview

## Packages

### Functional Package
In this package, the exercise is implemented using functional programming paradigms. This approach is ideal for enhancing logical competencies.

### OOP Package
The OOP package provides a solution to the same exercise, applying the best practices of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Kotlin. It incorporates features like extension functions, lambda functions, and employs the State design pattern using an enum class. This approach offers improved error handling techniques. Additionally, it includes a dedicated unit test file to ensure the code's correctness and robustness.
